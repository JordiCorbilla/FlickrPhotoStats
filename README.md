FlickrPhotoStats
================

Flickr Photo stats provides the ability to request information from your Flickr pool using the REST API.

The app only needs a valid API Key that can be requested in here:

https://www.flickr.com/services/api/explore/flickr.test.echo.

Once obtained, you can load your list or start a new one using the Api Key.

Example of the app:

It will keep a list of all the photos you add to keep track of them automatically.
The following information will be saved:
- Number of views.
- Number of Likes.
- Number of Comments.
- Last time it was updated.
- Affection (number of likes over number of views).

Each value is saved and stored over time so the took can display the trend of a particular photo.

Use Batch Update to easily update all the values and keep a good track record of your flickr pool.

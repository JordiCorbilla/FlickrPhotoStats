FlickrPhotoStats
================

Flickr Photo stats provides the ability to request information from your Flickr pool using the REST API.

The app only needs a valid API Key that can be requested in here:

https://www.flickr.com/services/api/explore/flickr.test.echo.

Once obtained, you can load your list or start a new one using the Api Key.

Example of the app:

![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-u9e9JX1v6Sc/VCabY59YGtI/AAAAAAAAEk8/Qm6ttjVHK7M/s1600/Example.png)

It will keep a list of all the photos you add to keep track of them automatically.
The following information will be saved:
- Number of views.
- Number of Likes.
- Number of Comments.
- Last time it was updated.
- Affection (number of likes over number of views).

Each value is saved and stored over time so the took can display the trend of a particular photo.

Code convention:
- > 1000 < 2000 views: blue.
- > 2000 < 4000 views: green.
- > 4000 views: red.
 
Use Batch Update to easily update all the values and keep a good track record of your flickr pool.

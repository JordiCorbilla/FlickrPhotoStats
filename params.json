  "body": "FlickrPhotoStats\r\n================\r\n\r\nFlickr Photo stats provides you with the ability to request information from your Flickr stream using the Web REST API. This tool does not need a PRO account to run against. It will keep track of your stats locally overtime.\r\n\r\nDownload the latest version here:\r\n\r\n[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/badge/downloads-1.2k-blue.svg)](https://github.com/JordiCorbilla/FlickrPhotoStats/releases/tag/4.8.0.2) [![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/badge/lines-47k-green.svg)](https://github.com/JordiCorbilla/FlickrPhotoStats/releases/tag/4.8.0.2) [![Stable Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-4.8.0.2rc-blue.svg)](https://github.com/JordiCorbilla/FlickrPhotoStats/releases/tag/4.8.0.2) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL-blue.svg)](https://github.com/JordiCorbilla/FlickrPhotoStats/releases/tag/4.8.0.2) [![Delphi version](https://img.shields.io/badge/delphi-10.1Berlin-red.svg)](https://github.com/JordiCorbilla/FlickrPhotoStats/releases/tag/4.8.0.2)\r\n\r\n**Additional libraries required:**\r\nThe application requires SSL authentication and for that it uses the libraries provided by OpenSSL.\r\nRemember to download the following libraries and place them in the application root:\r\n\r\n- [OpenSSL v1.02 32bits](http://indy.fulgan.com/SSL/openssl-1.0.2d-i386-win32.zip).\r\n- [OpenSSL v1.02 64bits](http://indy.fulgan.com/SSL/openssl-1.0.2d-x64_86-win64.zip).\r\n\r\n**License:** GNU General Public License.\r\n\r\nThe app only needs a valid *API Key* that can be requested in the App Garden where my application is already [published](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/72157639602915254/):\r\n\r\n[The App Garden - API request](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/?).\r\n\r\nOnce obtained, you can load your list or start a new one using the Api Key.\r\n\r\nAdditional info can be found in the following [**post**](http://thundaxsoftware.blogspot.co.uk/p/flickr-photo-analytics-v4.html) in my blog.\r\n\r\n**Example of the app**:\r\n\r\n**New Dashboard v4.8.0.2 (Windows 10 support) **:\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/JordiCorbilla/FlickrPhotoStats/raw/master/dashboard.png)\r\n![](https://github.com/JordiCorbilla/FlickrPhotoStats/raw/master/dashboard2.png)\r\n\r\n**Dashboard (previous versions)**:\r\n\r\n![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fFx_AXjkKjk/VhkkWW1GF-I/AAAAAAAAFIE/aosoNiSmji0/s640/10102015Image.png)\r\n\r\n**Processing**:\r\n\r\n![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h1K2_xTgOdo/VhklfDRPHCI/AAAAAAAAFIM/M3OHcdncoYo/s640/10102015Image.png)\r\n\r\n**Authentication**:\r\n\r\n![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-buVw7akFPG4/VdzYG7JkCcI/AAAAAAAAE_w/qolCi6kzKDY/s640/auth2.png)\r\n\r\nIt will keep a list of all the photos you add to keep track of them automatically.\r\nThe following information will be saved:\r\n- Number of views.\r\n- Number of Likes.\r\n- Number of Comments.\r\n- Last time it was updated.\r\n- Affection (number of likes over number of views).\r\n\r\nEach value is saved and stored over time so the tool can display the trend of a particular photo.\r\n\r\nCode convention:\r\n- > 1000 < 3000 views: blue.\r\n- > 3000 < 5000 views: green.\r\n- > 5000 < 8000 views: Olive.\r\n- > 8000 < 10000 views: Fuchsia. \r\n- > 10000 views: red.\r\n \r\nUse **Batch Update** to easily update all the values and keep a good track record of your flickr stream.\r\n\r\nVersion 4.8.0.2 (RC stable):\r\n- [FlickrPhotoStats(x64) v4.8.0.2](https://github.com/JordiCorbilla/FlickrPhotoStats/releases/tag/4.8.0.2).\r\n \r\nVersion 4.8.0.1 (RC stable):\r\n- [FlickrPhotoStats(x64) v4.8.0.1](https://app.box.com/s/fm0qqguhzbpt31fj97uori8ydgtcjkly).\r\n\r\n### Older versions:\r\n\r\nVersion 4.6 (RC):\r\n- [FlickrPhotoStats(x64) v4.6.0.1](https://app.box.com/s/fm0qqguhzbpt31fj97uori8ydgtcjkly).\r\n\r\nVersion 4.7 (RC):\r\n- [FlickrPhotoStats(x64) v4.7.0.1](https://app.box.com/s/9v3z1s1fu1wouipmlcfhfklda59qgzmb).\r\n\r\nOlder versions can be found here: [Archive](https://github.com/JordiCorbilla/FlickrPhotoStats/tree/v4.6.0.1).\r\n\r\n### Usage of the Flickr API\r\n\r\nYou can create an instance of ParseServer, and mount it on a new or existing Express website:\r\n\r\n```Delphi\r\n   //TFlickrRest exposes the methods of the Flickr API.\r\n   //THTTPRest exposes a REST approach with XML format\r\n   THttpRest.Post(TFlickrRest.New(optionsAgent).getInfo(id), procedure (iXMLRootNode : IXMLNode)\r\n    begin\r\n      views := iXMLRootNode.attributes['views'];\r\n    end);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n### Features for version 3.1:\r\n- Get the total list of photos using flickr.people.getPhotos for automatic population of the application.\r\n\r\n### Features for version 4.1:\r\n- OAuth authentication.\r\n- Get list of groups and create your own profiles for automatic population.\r\n- Totals for Albums.\r\n\r\n### Features for version 4.3:\r\n- Dashboard.\r\n- Trend lines.\r\n- Album population.\r\n\r\n### Features for version 4.4:\r\n- Dashboard upgrade.\r\n- Area series.\r\n- Performance improvements.\r\n- BatchUpdate to send emails out to users.\r\n- emails support HTML.\r\n- splash screen.\r\n- Photo filtering.\r\n\r\n### Features for version 4.5:\r\n- Dashboard upgrade.\r\n- Double click on graphs to expand.\r\n- Performance improvements.\r\n- BatchUpdate to send emails out to users.\r\n- emails support HTML.\r\n- splash screen.\r\n- Photo filtering.\r\n- Memory leaks.\r\n- Web dashboard using ASP.NET MVC.\r\n\r\n### Features for version 4.6:\r\n- Dashboard upgrade.\r\n- Trend upgrade.\r\n\r\n### Features for version 4.7:\r\n- Dashboard upgrade.\r\n- Data Backup in zip format.\r\n- Trend upgrade.\r\n\r\n### Features for version 4.8.0.1:\r\n- Consolidation of bug fixes from 4.7 version.\r\n- Performance improvements.\r\n- Parse.com integration.\r\n\r\n### Features for version 4.8.0.2:\r\n- Reduction of memory and time footprint:\r\n   Memory Footprint    before    after    % reduction \r\n     Load             768 Mb     25 Mb    97 %\r\n     Save             768 Mb     25 Mb    97 %\r\n\r\n   Time Footprint      before    after    % reduction \r\n     Load             135551 ms  178 ms  100 %\r\n     Save             115745 ms  135 ms  100 %\r\n- Multi-threaded approach to increase performance. Reduction of 99% of the time.\r\n\r\nSource code is available here.\r\n\r\nThe application can now use **OAuth** authentication using REST. The application itself can validate the user tokens and provide all the flow within the application. I will write a post about this in my blog.\r\n\r\nDeveloped with Delphi 10.1 Berlin and C# and using [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) libraries.\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\n### Version 4.4:\r\n- Additional photo filtering.\r\n- Speed improvements.\r\n\r\n### Version 4.5:\r\n- Authentication improvements.\r\n- Pool improvements.\r\n \r\n### Version 4.6:\r\n- Automatic backup.\r\n- Saving the history independently.\r\n\r\n### Version 4.7:\r\n- Stable and highly functional release.\r\n- Pool and album handling.\r\n\r\n### Version 4.8:\r\n- Memory and CPU performance.\r\n\r\n### Version 5:\r\n- Saving the repository in a SQL DB (MySQL, SQL Server).\r\n- For version 5 I will start my hosted version where I will be able to take users on-board and just email the results back.\r\n\r\nPlatform Support\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nIt works under Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10 and Windows 2012.\r\n\r\nMinimum Requirements\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThis application is memory intensive and it will require loads of memory overtime. A year worth of history is about 500Mb in memory. Minumum recommended memory is 4Gb with a cpu with 4 cores (64 bits). Google can detect the constant sending/receiving of requests as a robot. Recommended screen resolution: 1920x1200. Minimum (1600x1200)\r\n\r\n**Licence**\r\n-------\r\n\r\n    Flickr Photo Analytics Copyright (C) 2015 Jordi Corbilla\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU \r\n    General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License,\r\n    or (at your option) any later version.\r\n    \r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even \r\n    the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
